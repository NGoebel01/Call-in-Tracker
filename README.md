# Call-in-Tracker
I initially created the 'Mold Call Log' Excel spreadsheet to keep track of clients who were calling in to have our company come out and assess their home or business for mold/water damage. After seeing the potential to use it for predicting our busiest times of year for call-ins, I created a "Stats" page that automatically outputted a bar chart of how many calls we received per month. Using the data from 2021, we dedicated more resources to this branch of our business during those peak months to serve more clients. This resulted in 10% increase in clients served from 2021 to 2022.

Note: The 'Mold Call Log' was edited to remove identifiable information, which broke parts of the "Stats" page. The original chart works as intended.
